These symptoms are commonly referred to as the \"cold stage\" and \"hot stage.\"\n"

      "Answer: If you have recently traveled to a region where malaria is common and are experiencing symptoms like confusion, seizures, or loss of consciousness, or visible yellowing of the eyes or skin (jaundice), and are either a young child or a pregnant woman, you should seek immediate medical attention as these groups are at higher risk for rapid deterioration. Malaria can quickly become life-threatening if it progresses to \"complicated\" or \"severe\" malaria. Additionally, if you develop a high fever, you should also seek medical attention. Personal protection measures such as using Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) while sleeping and applying mosquito repellents containing DEET, Picaridin, or IR3535 to exposed skin can help prevent malaria by avoiding mosquito bites and controlling the mosquito population. However, if you are experiencing paleness and shortness of breath, it may indicate anemia, which is caused by the destruction of red blood cells, and you should consult a doctor.\n"
